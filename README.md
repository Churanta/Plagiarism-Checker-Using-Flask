# Plagiarism Checker Using Flask

Web application of Plagiarism Checker using Python-Flask. TF-IDF and cosine similarity is a very common technique. It allows the system to quickly retrieve documents similar to a search query. Similarly, based on the same concept instead of retrieving documents similar to a query, it checks for how similar the query is to the existing database file. This is a Python program that calculates the similarity between a user-provided input text and a database of texts. The similarity score is calculated using the cosine similarity algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/example/plagiarism-checker.git
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: cd plagiarism-checker
3. Create a virtual enviroment 'Python -m venv env'
4. Install the required packages: pip install -r req.txt
5. run this command in terminal 'run.sh'

## Usage

- Run the program: python app.py

- Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000/

- Enter your input text in the provided text box and click the "CHECK PLAGIARISM" button.

- The program will return a percentage score indicating the similarity between your input text and the texts in the database.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Getting Started

- To run the program, you must have Python 3.x installed on your computer.

## Steps:

1. User enters a query
2. Query gets processed (Uppercase to lowercase, Removal of punctuationmarks, etc.)
3. Calculations are done (Term Frequency, Cosine Similarity)
4. The Plagiarism Percentage is returned on the web page

## Python-Flask

1. Flask is a light-weight web framework for Python
2. Easy to work with (Same syntax as of Python)
3. While Flask addresses itself as a "micro-framework", it is not lacking in features or power, especially with a clutch of extensions to support features such as authentication, databases and so on
4. Comprehensive documentation available

## Acknowledgments

This program is based on the cosine similarity algorithm, which was originally developed for information retrieval and text mining. Thanks to the original developers of the algorithm and the creators of the Python programming language.
